+   2. a binomial test that is used when genes are associated with two counts, and

+ 
+ To correct for multiple testing and interdependency of the tests, family-wise error rates are computed based on random permutations of the gene-associated
+ variables.  GOfuncR also provides tools for exploring the ontology graph and the annotations, and options to take gene-length or spatial clustering of genes
+ into account.  It is also possible to provide custom gene coordinates, annotations and ontologies.

+ The `pfunct' command can be used to find all sorts of information about functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.
+ 
+ The `pahole' command can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data according to command line directions.
+ 
+ Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from it can be used to further format a number of records.
+ 
+ Finally, the `btfdiff' command can be used to compare the output of pahole from BTF and DWARF, to make sure they produce the same results.
